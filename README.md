Solar Panel Tracking System
Project Overview
The Solar Panel Tracking System is designed to automatically adjust the direction of a solar panel to maximize sunlight exposure. Using a combination of Arduino, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and motors, the system ensures that the solar panel tracks the sun’s movement throughout the day, improving the efficiency of energy collection.

Components Used:
Arduino: A microcontroller used to handle the logic and motor control.
LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors): Sensors that measure light intensity, allowing the system to detect the position of the sun and adjust the panel's position accordingly.
Motors: Motors are used to physically rotate the solar panel. The Arduino sends signals to move the panel based on input from the LDRs.
How It Works:
Light Detection: The system uses two LDR sensors to detect the intensity of sunlight at different points on the solar panel. One sensor is placed at the front and the other at the back of the panel.
Data Processing: The Arduino compares the readings from the two LDRs. The panel will be rotated to the side that receives more sunlight.
Panel Adjustment: Based on the sensor data, the Arduino sends commands to the motors, adjusting the solar panel’s position to face the sun and optimize energy absorption.
Benefits:
Increased Efficiency: The system ensures that the solar panel is always positioned to receive maximum sunlight, which increases the energy output.
Automation: The tracking system operates automatically, requiring no manual adjustments.
Cost-Effective: The project uses inexpensive components like Arduino and LDRs, making it an affordable solution for improving solar energy efficiency.
Project Setup:
Arduino: Set up the Arduino board and program it with the logic to control the motors based on the input from the LDRs.
LDR Setup: Place the two LDRs at opposite ends of the solar panel.
Motor Control: Use motors (e.g., servo motors or DC motors) to adjust the position of the panel based on the Arduino commands.
Connect Everything: Connect the LDRs, Arduino, and motors to form the complete tracking system.
Potential Applications:
Renewable Energy: This system can be integrated into solar energy installations to maximize energy capture.
Sustainable Technology: It can contribute to green technology solutions that improve the efficiency of solar power systems.
Installation:
Requirements:
Arduino (any compatible version)
LDRs (2 pieces)
Motors (e.g., Servo Motors)
Jumper Wires
Solar Panel (for testing)
Arduino IDE (for programming)
Steps:
Place the LDR sensors on opposite sides of the solar panel.
Wire the Arduino to the LDRs and motors.
Upload the program to the Arduino that allows it to read the LDR input and control the motors accordingly.
Power the Arduino and observe the solar panel adjusting its position to track the sun.
